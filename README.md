# ONT-huhu

Nat Forsdick, 2021

Repo containing all scripts associated with huhu (*Prionoplus reticularis*) genome assembly from ONT data.

This is a [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/) High Quality Genomes and [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://landcareresearch.co.nz/) project, aiming to produce a reference genome assembly for the Aotearoa endemic huhu beetle.

Project collaborators: Thomas Buckley, Manpreet Dhami, Ana Podolyan, Duckchul Park, Natalie Forsdick.

Research partners: [Te Awah≈çhonu Forest Trust](https://www.teawahohonu.co.nz/).

Data types: ONT MinION long-read data for base assembly, Illumina short-read resequencing data for QC and error correction, Omni-C data for genome scaffolding.

Publications and outputs: TBD.
