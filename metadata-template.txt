# METADATA TEMPLATE

1. The main function is simply to describe, in plain English, what data is contained in the folder, for the benefit of future researchers (including future you!).

2. Can include scientific keywords and metadata to assist search engines.

3. Include PI and collaborator names, and if possible a contact email address that will remain active permanently.

4. The README file should always be in plain text format (.txt), so that it can be opened by any device, now and in the future.
